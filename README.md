# QuizApp
My graduate thesis on the topic of Enterprise Quiz App(a new approach for better performance on Employee engagement). 

Technical Approach
Overview:
QuizApp has been designed to have a tiered architecture. The real strength of QuizApp is in its robust and flexible data model. However, not all users want to have to know this data model inside and out. The API layer allows a developer to understand Rest endpoints and read/save them. This layer can be used in different channels like web, IOS, Android, etc.,

Authorization and Authentication:
QuizApp has a very granulated permit system. Every action is associated with privilege. Admin can add the Exam, Questions and can see the Leaderboard. Whereas a user can only attempt an exam and view the Leaderboard.

Technologies & Tools used: 
Jersey Restful web services(JSR 311)Spring Framework,JAVA,Angular JS,J2EE7,Maven,Eclipse IDE (Neon),MySQL (5.1),JSON,REST calls
